	United by a "general sense of chaos," Visual Editions founders 
	Britt Iversen and Anna Gerber partner with writers and designers to publish work that marries compelling visual literature with mind-bendingly inventive production techniques. Jaw-dropping though the results may be, the duo is dedicated to making books that are as nice to read as they are to look at, and they're all the lovelier for it.

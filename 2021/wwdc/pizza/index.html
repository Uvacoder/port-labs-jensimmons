<h1>Pizza</h1>
<p class="foolishness"> Is there any food better than pizza? I don't think so. Its simplest form is really my favorite â€“ a perfect thin crust, a barely-altered tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and a light sprinkling of basil. But I like all of the less pure interpretations of pizza too. From a mushroom-and-sausage-filled Chicago-style deep dish to a California sourdough crust with fresh corn, feta cheese, and cilantro, to an almost sweet Hawaiian pie (doesn't tell Enrica about that one), I just love it all. Is there anyone who doesn't love pizza? I pity the fool who does not love pizza.</p>

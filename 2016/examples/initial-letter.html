      <p>The carrot is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, and yellow varieties exist. It has a crisp texture when fresh. The most commonly eaten part of a carrot is a taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. It is a domesticated form of the wild carrot Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged and more palatable, less woody-textured edible taproot. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reports that world production of carrots and turnips (these plants are combined by the FAO for reporting purposes) for calendar year 2011 was almost 35.658 million tonnes. Almost half were grown in China. Carrots are widely used in many cuisines, especially in the preparation of salads, and carrot salads are a tradition in many regional cuisines.</p>

      <p>Is the top line of this paragraph sticking out further than it should? That's because of <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147977">this webkit bug</a>. Which has been fixed, but has not been shipped in Safari yet. Hopefully Apple will ship the fix soon. It would be great to have it in Safari 9.1. Until then, we can't use initial-letter on real websites.</p>
      <p>If you want to see this demo without this bug, try it in <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org">Webkit Nightly</a>.</p>
      <p>If you are on the current release of Safari, and you <em>don't</em> see the first line sticking out beyond the rest, then hooray! Safari has been fixed. (And I should erase this note.)</p>
